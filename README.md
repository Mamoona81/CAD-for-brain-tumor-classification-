# CAD-for-brain-tumor-classification-
Developed a deep learning based classification technique for 3,064 MRI Tumor images, resulting in a brain tumor diagnosis prediction accuracy of 98%. Investigated the efficacy of convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model that involves convolution layers ,pooling and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) activation function.
